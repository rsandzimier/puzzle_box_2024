# Puzzle Box 2024
## Instructions
- Plug in Micro-USB cable to power the puzzle.
- If there are already LEDs that are solidly lit when the puzzle is powered up, shake the puzzle and press buttons randomly until all of the LEDs are off or blinking. It is okay if 1 green LED is lit.
- The goal of the puzzle is to have all 9 LEDs solidly lit at the same time. See image below
- Blinking LEDs do not count as solved. They have to be solidly lit.
- Nothing has to be removed, disassembled, unplugged, or forced to solve the puzzle.
- The buttons and switches on the top face of the puzzle can be pressed/toggled.
- The screw heads on the sides of the puzzle are for assembling the puzzle and are not related to the solution.

SAFETY NOTE: The puzzle should be safe, but just in case (this is a hobbyist project):
- Don't plug the USB cable into a computer or any other devices of value. Use a USB power bank or USB power adapter.
- Don't leave plugged in while unattended for extended periods of time.

  <details>
    <summary><b>General Hint 2:</b></summary>
    The 3 colored groups of LEDs are completely independent from each other. Anything on the puzzle used in the solution for one color will not be used in the solution for the other colors.

  </details>
  <details>
    <summary><b>Red Puzzle Hint 5:</b></summary>
    Each LED can only be turned on by the button below it. But doing so may turn off other LEDs. And doing so at the wrong time might reset the puzzle.
  </details>  
  <details>
    <summary><b>Red Puzzle Hint 6:</b></summary>
    Take note of any patterns you find. Patterns repeat.
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary><b>Red Puzzle Hint 7:</b></summary>

  </details>
  <details>
    <summary><b>Red Puzzle Hint 8:</b></summary>
    Think of it as moving the light from left to right. Once you've moved the light all the way to the right, start back over from the left.

    The yellow LED is blinking. Is there any pattern to the blinking?
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary><b>Yellow Puzzle Hint 3:</b></summary>
    The length of the blinks and the gaps between the blinks is not constant.
  </details>

    <summary><b>Yellow Puzzle Hint 11:</b></summary>
    The dip switches are labeled from 1-8.
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary><b>Yellow Puzzle Hint 12:</b></summary>
    The numbers on the side of the box map the order of the blinks to the order of the dip switches.
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary><b>Yellow Puzzle Hint 13:</b></summary>
    The 1st blink corresponds to the 5th dip switch.
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary><b>Yellow Puzzle Hint 14:</b></summary>
    The 2nd blink corresponds to the 4th dip switch. The 3rd blink corresponds to the 7th dip switch.
  </details>
  <details>

    <summary><b>Green Puzzle Hint 1:</b></summary>
    Focus on 1 green LED. Can you find a way to turn it on?
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary><b>Green Puzzle Hint 2:</b></summary>
    Can you do the same thing to turn on a 2nd LED? A 3rd? A 4th?
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary><b>Green Puzzle Hint 3:</b></summary>
    Can you figure out what is causing the LEDs to turn off?
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary><b>Green Puzzle Hint 4:</b></summary>
    There is a ball moving inside the puzzle. Moving the ball to certain positions will turn LEDs on, but other positions will turn the LEDs off.
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary><b>Green Puzzle Hint 5:</b></summary>
    Moving the ball to the corners will turn on the corresponding LED. See the green circles in the diagram below. But moving the ball to the reset zones (red X's in diagram below) will turn the LEDs off.

  </details>
  <details>
    <summary><b>Green Puzzle Hint 6:</b></summary>
    Can you find a way to move the ball to all 4 corners without crossing the reset zones?
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary><b>Green Puzzle Hint 7:</b></summary>
    Maybe you are thinking about the puzzle 2-dimensionally.
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary><b>Green Puzzle Hint 8:</b></summary>
    There is a different path for the ball to follow, but requires the ball to move to a different height to use that path.
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary><b>Green Puzzle Hint 9:</b></summary>
    Flip the box over. Does that open up any new path for the ball to take?
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary><b>Green Puzzle Hint 10:</b></summary>
    Turn on 2 LEDs, flip the box over (without passing through the reset zones), use the alternative path to move to the other side of the box, flip the box back over, and turn on the remaining 2 LEDs.
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary><b>Green Puzzle Hint 11:</b></summary>
    The paths the ball can move on are shown in the diagram below. The blue path is the 2D path the ball in confined to if the puzzle is held upright. The pink path is accessible by flipping the puzzle over and allows the ball to get to the other side without triggering the reset zones. Paths are for reference and not drawn to scale.
